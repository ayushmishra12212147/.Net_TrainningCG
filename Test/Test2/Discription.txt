Use Case: Digital Petty Cash Le
A Petty Cash system is used by businesses to manage small, incidental expenditures (like tea, stationery, or taxi fares) using a "float" or "imprest" fund.1 This use case requires the development of a Digital Petty Cash Ledger that allows a cashier to record income (replenishments) and expenses. The system must be built using C# and must demonstrate type-safe data handling without any external database.
2. Objective 
The objective of this test is to verify the student's ability to:
•	Encapsulation & Abstraction: Define clear data models for financial transactions.
•	Inheritance: Differentiate between types of transactions (Income vs. Expense).
•	Generics: Create a reusable Ledger or Repository to handle any transaction type while maintaining type safety.
•	Collections: Efficiently store, retrieve, and filter transaction records using List<T> or Dictionary<K,V>.2
3. Requirements
The student must implement the following logic in C#:
A. The Data Model (OOP)
•	Abstract Class: Transaction (Properties: Id, Date, Amount, Description).
•	Derived Classes:
o	ExpenseTransaction: Adds a Category property (e.g., Office, Travel, Food).
o	IncomeTransaction: Adds a Source property (e.g., Main Cash, Bank Transfer).
•	Interface: IReportable with a method GetSummary() to be implemented by all transaction types.
B. The Ledger Logic (Generics & Collections)
•	Generic Class: Ledger<T> where T : Transaction.
•	Storage: Internal List<T> to hold the transaction history.
•	Methods:
o	AddEntry(T entry): Adds a transaction.
o	GetTransactionsByDate(DateTime date): Returns a filtered list.
o	CalculateTotal(): Uses LINQ or a loop to sum up the Amount.
C. Technical Restrictions
•	Storage: In-memory only (no SQL, no File I/O).
•	Type Safety: The generic Ledger must ensure that only Transaction objects can be processed.

4. Use Case Definition
Use Case ID	UC-FIN-01
Use Case Name	Record and Balance Petty Cash
Actor	Petty Cash Custodian
Pre-condition	The application is running; a ledger for Expenses and a ledger for Income are initialized.
Description	The custodian adds a fund replenishment (Income) and then records multiple minor expenses. The system then calculates the remaining balance.
Main Success Scenario (Steps)
1.	The user creates a Ledger<IncomeTransaction> to track funds received from the main office.
2.	The user records a $500 replenishment from "Main Cash".
3.	The user creates a Ledger<ExpenseTransaction> to track daily spends.
4.	The user records an expense of $20 for "Stationery" and $15 for "Team Snacks".
5.	The system uses a generic method to display the total from both ledgers.
6.	The user calculates the Net Balance (Total Income - Total Expenses).

5. Expected Results
The student’s solution should produce the following output:
•	Compile-time Check: If a student tries to add an IncomeTransaction into a Ledger<ExpenseTransaction>, the code should fail to compile (proving Generic constraints).
•	Correct Calculations: The console must show the total spent ($35) and the total received ($500) accurately. 
•	Polymorphic Output: A loop iterating through a List<Transaction> should be able to call GetSummary() and display unique details for both Income and Expenses.

6. Conclusion
By completing this use case, the student demonstrates a professional understanding of Software Architecture. Moving beyond simple variables to a Generic-based Ledger system shows that the developer can build scalable financial tools that are less prone to runtime errors and easy to maintain as business requirements grow.
